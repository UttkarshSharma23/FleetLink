# Steps Taken During Development of FleetLink Logistics Vehicle Booking System

## Project Setup
1. **Initialize Project**: Created a new Node.js project using `npm init -y` to generate `package.json`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Installed necessary packages including Express, Mongoose, and dotenv for environment variable management.
   ```
   npm install express mongoose dotenv
   ```

## Directory Structure
- Established a clear directory structure to separate concerns:
  - `src/`: Contains all source code.
  - `config/`: Configuration files for database and environment variables.
  - `controllers/`: Logic for handling incoming requests.
  - `middlewares/`: Custom middleware for error handling and request validation.
  - `models/`: Mongoose models for MongoDB schemas.
  - `repositories/`: Data access layer for interacting with models.
  - `routes/`: API endpoint definitions.
  - `services/`: Business logic for bookings and vehicles.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions for common operations.
  - `tests/`: Unit tests for critical components.

## Database Configuration
- **MongoDB Connection**: Implemented database connection logic in `src/config/db.js` to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- **Environment Variables**: Loaded environment variables in `src/config/env.js` to manage sensitive information like database URI.

## API Development
- **Controllers**: Developed controllers for handling bookings and vehicles:
  - `booking.controller.js`: Functions for creating bookings and checking availability.
  - `vehicle.controller.js`: Functions for adding and retrieving vehicles.
  
- **Routes**: Defined API routes in `src/routes/` to map requests to controller functions.

## Middleware Implementation
- Created middleware for:
  - **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in `errorHandler.js`.
  - **Async Handling**: Wrapped async route handlers to catch errors in `asyncHandler.js`.
  - **Request Validation**: Validated incoming requests against defined schemas in `validateRequest.js`.

## Business Logic
- Implemented services for handling business logic:
  - `booking.service.js`: Logic for managing bookings, including availability checks.
  - `vehicle.service.js`: Logic for managing vehicles, including adding and searching for available vehicles.

## Testing
- Developed unit tests for critical components:
  - Tests for booking and vehicle services in `src/tests/`.
  - Tests for controllers to ensure correct request handling.

## Documentation
- Created `steps.md` to document the development process and decisions made.
- Added a `README.md` for project overview and usage instructions.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Explore adding a frontend interface for better user interaction.
- Plan for deployment and scaling strategies.
